# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One of the best ways to ensure that one's code is functional and secure is to perform testing on your code. Some common techniques for testing code includes unit testing, static testing, functional testin and regression testing. We can also ensure that our code is functional by following the software requirements that were set our by the client.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
One of the best ways to encorperate user needs into a program is by first establishing the program requirements. One we have the program requirements outlined I am better able to understand and interpret what the user wants the program to do. I also ensure that the user needs are incorperated into the program by writing and running unit test for each reqirement to ensure that all user requirements are met.

# How do I approach designing software?
One way that I approach designing a software is by following the Software Development Life cycle (SDLC). When following this cycle I ensure that all seven phases are followed. I start off by plannning the project ensuring that I have a good understanding of the project, then move on to analysing the project (gathering program requirements), then I begin the designing and developmenting phase. Once the program is developed I can then move on the testing, if all testing is completed and passed and the project is approved by the client I move on to the implementation and maintainance phase.
